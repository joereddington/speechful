From the intro to our first podcast:

> This is an episode by episode review of the ABC show [Speechless](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5592146/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt), starring [Minnie Driver](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000378/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t1) and [Micah Fowler](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5094896/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t5). We’re talking a little bit about the episode, and we’re also using it as a jumping off point to talk about a range of related issues.
> 
> Why should you listen to us? So I like to believe I have an interesting viewpoint. I was a awkward nerdy child who had a brother who used a voice system very similar to JJ’s. I did, in fact, grow up as Ray, and I’ve been excited about the show since it was announced.
> 
> Quite a lot of this podcast will consist of me either applauding or complaining about the situations that come up and how much they resonate with someone who grew up in a similar situation.
> 
> Joe
