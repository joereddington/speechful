Today we are talking about Speechless S01E02: **[B-O-N–BONFIRE](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5952254/?ref_=ttep_ep3 "B-O-N--BONFIRE")**

During which we spend a lot of time talking about the fact that Joe is going to be a father and complaining about people who run. Unhelpfully we recorded this a while ago so Joe now has a nine month old baby and has joined a running club…

We also talk about Disneyland a lot.
